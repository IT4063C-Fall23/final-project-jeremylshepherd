# # Affect of Marijuana legalization on crime rates
# 
# ![Banner](./assets/banner.jpeg)

# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# 
# Evaluate the impact of marijuana legalization on other areas of crime through comparative analysis to establish/refute correlation.

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# Does marijuana legalization lead to an increase in other areas of criminality?

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# I suspect there will be some increases in other areas such as impaired driving. I do not have a strong inclination towards the degree it is impacted.

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# [Seattle Crime stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/city-of-seattle/seattle-crime-stats)
# [Denver Crime stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/denver-crime-data/data)
# [Kansas City Crime](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/riteshkadakoti/crime-dataset-kansas)
# 
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# My working plan to compare 2 large cities where marijuana was first legalized (2012) for recreational use. I plan compare pre and post legalization crime trends. Then further compare/contrast that with a large city that had not (until this year) legalized recreational use. I am still ruminating on the mechanics of how to best do that.
