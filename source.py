# # Affect of Marijuana legalization on crime rates
# 
# ![Banner](./assets/banner.jpeg)

# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# 
# Evaluate the impact of marijuana legalization on other areas of crime through comparative analysis to establish/refute correlation.

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# Does marijuana legalization lead to an increase in other areas of criminality?

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# I suspect there will be some increases in other areas such as impaired driving. I do not have a strong inclination towards the degree it is impacted.

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# [Seattle Crime stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/city-of-seattle/seattle-crime-stats)
# [Denver Crime stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/denver-crime-data/data)
# [Kansas City Crime](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/riteshkadakoti/crime-dataset-kansas)
# 
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# My working plan to compare 2 large cities where marijuana was first legalized (2012) for recreational use. I plan compare pre and post legalization crime trends. Then further compare/contrast that with a large city that had not (until this year) legalized recreational use. I am still ruminating on the mechanics of how to best do that.

# ### Exploratory Data Analysis
# 
# Data visualizations to evaluate the data in order to form conclusions about whether marijuana legalization had a tangential impact on other aspects of crime.
# I am paying particular attention to the 2-3 year period before and after legalization.

# ### Intitial thoughts
# The data from Seattle 01 and Kansas City do not appear to provide much in the way of usable data. Denver and Seattle 02 show some promise. The datasets are structured differently but I may be able to extract the necessary data from them to answer the question I am researching. I will need to try to find another comparison city for evaluation against the cities with legalized marijuana.

# ### Data cleaned and ready for use
# The missing values are immaterial to the scope of analysis and can be safely ignored. The four duplicates from Seattle have been dropped.
